            <strong>The Green Cloister</strong> is an independent, student-run
            environmental publication founded and coded by Jensen and Jason, two
            green-minded students at Winchester College.

            The name <em>"the Green Cloister"</em> draws inspiration from the
            historic 
            <em>"War Cloister"</em>  at Winchester College, representing our
            commitment to fostering a platform for thoughtful discussion and
            action on a wide range of environmental issues.

          <p className="text-textPrimary leading-relaxed">
            As founders and chief editors, our goal is to produce and provide a
            platform; exploring diverse ecological topics and inspiring positive
            environmental change. While our core editorial team and lead editor
            Calam is based at our school, we proudly feature contributions from
            students at several schools across Hampshire, united by a shared
            passion for sustainability and climate engagement on campus and in
            our local county.
